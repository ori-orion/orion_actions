# How far above the surface to "drop" the object. It makes sense to drop bin bags a bit above the floor, for example. It makes less sense to drop fragile objects so this should be 0.0 by default. Negative values *shouldn't* result in the robot placing the item through solid surfaces, but don't try it anyway.
float32 drop_object_by_metres
# The robot will check that a weight change of check_weight_grams grams has occured after placing the object, e.g. to detect whether the object is somehow caught on the gripper. If detected_weight_change < check_weight_grams, the robot will wiggle the gripper to try to drop the object. Weight checking is not precise, so give the smallest practical weight change for the object being placed. If <=0, no weight checking will be carried out.
